        <h1>PREPARING THE CROISSANTS</h1>
        <p>
            First, let’s get our croissants ready. Preheat your oven to 350°F
            (175°C). Slice the top off each croissant and gently carve out the
            center, creating a boat-like shape. Be careful not to cut through 
            the bottom or sides—you want to create a perfect little vessel 
            for our delicious fillings. Once you’ve carved out the center, 
            press down to make a well, ensuring there’s enough space for the 
            eggs and other ingredients. This step is crucial as it creates a 
            sturdy base to hold all the tasty ingredients without spilling 
            over. You can buy croissants from anywhere but my favorites are 
            from Costco or Sam’s Club.
        </p>
        <h1>METHOD # 1: BEEF BACON AND CHEDDAR</h1>
        <p>
            For our first method, we’ll start with the classic bacon and 
            cheddar combination. Add shredded cheddar cheese to the bottom of
            each croissant well. Place a strip of beef bacon on top of that 
            into the well of each croissant. You can cut the strip of bacon 
            in half to make it easier to place inside. No need to pre-cook 
            the bacon—it will cook perfectly in the oven and infuse the 
            croissant with its savory flavor. Now, crack an egg into each 
            croissant boat, directly on top of the bacon and cheese. Season
            with salt and black pepper to taste. Add a little bit more 
            cheddar cheese on top. You can opt to only add cheese on top and 
            not in the bottom of the well too. The cheese on top will get 
            more crispy while the cheese underneath will get ooey and gooey 
            so pick your preference or go for both!
        </p>
        <p>
            Place the filled croissants on a baking sheet and pop them in the 
            oven. Bake for 15-20 minutes, or until the eggs are set and the 
            crosissants are golden brown. Make sure to take them out before the 
            egg yolks completely harden. The best texture is a jammy yolk – 
            not too runny and not too firm!

            <b>Tips and Tricks:</b>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>Cheese Choices:</b> 
                Feel free to substitute the cheddar with
                other cheeses like mozzarella or gouda for different flavors.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Protein Choice:</b>
                You can swap the beef bacon for turkey bacon or use deli meat 
                like turkey ham or even pastrami.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Seasoning:</b>
                Add a dash of paprika or chili flakes for a bit of a kick.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <b>Air Fryer Option:</b>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Preheat your air fryer to 320°F (160°C).</li>
            <li>Place the filled croissants in the air fryer basket.</li>
            <li>
                Cook for 10-12 minutes, checking halfway through to ensure
                even cooking.

        <h1>METHOD #2: TOMATO, BASIL, AND FETA</h1>
        <p>
            While those are baking, let’s move on to the tomato, basil, and feta 
            variation. In a bowl, whisk together the eggs, salt, black pepper,
            and a pinch of Italian seasoning. This will give our eggs a nice,
            herby flavor. Stir in the diced grape tomatoes, chopped basil, and
            crumbled feta cheese. The tomatoes add a juicy, slightly sweet 
            burst of flavor, while the basil brings in a fresh, aromatic 
            note, and the feta offers a tangy creaminess. Spoon the egg 
            mixture into the remaining croissants, filling them evenly.
            Place these on another baking sheet and bake alongside the
            bacon and cheddar croissants for 15-20 minutes, or until the
            eggs are set and the croissants are golden brown.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Tips and Tricks:</b>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>Tomato Prep:</b>
                Pat the diced tomatoes dry with a paper towel to prevent 
                excess moisture in the croissants.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Cheese Variations:</b>
                Swap out the feta for goat cheese or ricotta for a different 
                texture and flavor. You could even add cottage cheese for a
                protein boost.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Fresh Herbs:</b>
                Substitute basil with fresh parsley or chives for a different 
                twist.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Egg Whites:</b>
                To make this lighter, you can just use carton egg whites instead 
                of whole eggs.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <b>Air Fryer Option:</b>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Preheat your air fryer to 320°F (160°C).</li>
            <li>Place the filled croissants in the air fryer basket.</li>
            <li>
                Cook for 10-12 minutes, checking halfway through to ensure 
                even cooking.
