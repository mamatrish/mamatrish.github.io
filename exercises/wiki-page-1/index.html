            <b>Crown shyness</b> (also 
            <i>canopy disengagement</i>,<sup>[1]</sup>
            <i>canopy shyness</i>,<sup>[2]</sup>
            <i>or inter-crown spacing</i><sup>[3]</sup>)is a phenomenon 
            observed in some tree species, in which the crowns of fully 
            stocked trees do not touch each other, forming a canopy with 
            channel-like gaps.<sup>[4][5]</sup> The phenomenon is most 
            prevalent among trees of the same species, but also occurs
             between trees of different species.<sup>[6][7]</sup>
              There exist many hypotheses as to why crown shyness is an 
              adaptivebehavior, and research suggests that it might inhibit
               spread of leaf-eating insect larvae.<sup>[8]</sup>
