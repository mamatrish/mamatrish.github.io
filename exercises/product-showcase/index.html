                            True to its name, The Original Chai Tea Latte is, well,
                            the original that started a coffeehouse trend. Inspired by
                            our founder's trip to the Himalayas, this flavorful chai 
                            latte blend combines the chai spices of its Eastern 
                            heritage with a Western twist. Our sweet and mildly spiced 
                            signature flavor blends black tea, honey, smooth vanilla 
                            and chai spices in every delicious sip. To make a delicious 
                            chai latte, just mix equal parts concentrate and milk or 
                            dairy substitute. Heat it up or pour it over ice for a rich,
                            sweet, creamy chai tea latte that you'll enjoy. Oregon Chai
                            strives to bring incredible flavor to the world, cup after
                            cup, with minimal environmental impact. To do that, we

                        Chai is a blend of black tea, spices, and herbs. It is 
                        often served with milk and sweetened with sugar or honey.
                        Chai is a spiced tea derived from the Assam region of India.
                        Over the past 10 years, it's grown in popularity around 
                        the globe.  Chai is believed to have numerous benefits 
                        such as aiding digestion, boosting the immune system, and 
                        improving heart health.
