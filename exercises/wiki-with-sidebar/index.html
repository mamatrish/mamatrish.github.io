                <h1>Fire Performance</h1>
                <p>
                    Fire performance is a group of performance arts or skills 
                    that involve the manipulation of fire. Fire performance 
                    typically involves equipment or other objects made with one
                    or more wicks which are designed to sustain a large enough 
                    flame to create a visual effect.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Fire performance includes skills based on juggling, baton 
                    twirling, poi spinning, and other forms of object 
                    manipulation. It also includes skills such as fire 
                    reathing, fire eating, and body burning; sometimes called 
                    fakir skills. Fire performance has various styles of
                    performance including fire dancing; the use of fire as a 
                    finale in an otherwise non-fire performance; and the use of 
                    fire skills as 'dangerous' stunts. Performances can be done
                    as choreographed routines to music (this type being 
                    related to dance or rhythmic gymnastics); as freestyle 
                    (performed to music or not) performances; or performed 
                    with vocal interaction with the audience. Some aspect of 
                    fire performance can be found in a wide variety of 
                    cultural traditions and rituals from around the world.

                    One of the earliest mentions of fire performance was at the 
                    ceremony of Simchat Beit HaShoeivah during the holidays of 
                    sukkot of the Second Temple by the Jews in Jerusalem Circa 
                    10AD - 70AD. It has been said about Rabbi Simeon ben 
                    Gamaliel that when he was rejoicing with the joy of the 
                    Water-Drawing he would take eight burning torches in one 
                    hand and toss them upwards; he tossed one and caught one,
                    and never did one touch the other. [1]

                    Ancient Aztecs performed a fire dance dedicated to 
                    Xiuhtecuhtli, the god of fire.[2] The Aztec fire dance is 
                    performed today for tourists in Mexico. In Bali, the Angel 
                    Dance and the Fire Dance, regularly performed for tourists,
                    have origins in ancient rituals. Both the Angel Dance and 
                    the Fire Dance originated in a trance ritual called the 
                    sanghyang, a ritual dance "performed to ward off witches 
                    at the time of an epidemic."[3] Also known as the "horse 
                    dance" men perform the dance by holding rods representing 
                    horses, while leaping around burning coconut husks, and
                    walking through the flames. Jamaica, French Polynesia,
                    Antigua, Cuba and Saint Lucia are other locations where
                    fire dances are recreated for tourists. The Siddha Jats
                    of the Thar Desert in India perform traditional fire 
                    dances as part of the Spring festival. Fire dancing is 
                    performed to music played on drums and the behr. There
                    are variations of the fire dancing; men often perform
                    a dance that involves walking on hot coals. A large 
                    fire is created and allowed to burn down until it is 
                    a pit of glowing embers. The performers then jump in 
                    and out of the pit kicking up the embers to create 
                    showers of sparks while women perform a dance while
                    balancing flaming tin pots on their heads. Today 
                    this ritual is often performed for tourists.

                    Another form of fire dancing comes from the people of 
                    Polynesia. It is believed that the Maori people of New 
                    Zealand would soak a ball attached to string in fuel, light
                    it and perform dancing rituals. "Poi" is a Maori word
                    meaning â€œball on a string" making the Maori people the 
                    originators of the flow equipment still popular today.[4]

                    There are organized events in various parts of the world 
                    teaching fire arts and object manipulation. These events 
                    which can be fire festivals or workshops at juggling or 
                    music festivals are popular in US, Canada, United Kingdom 
                    and Australia.[6]

                    Fire performance skills are inherently dangerous and only 
                    careful use of the props, storage of the fuel and 
                    performance in appropriate spaces will mean that the risks 
                    are minimised. Fire insurance policies all require fire 
                    performers to carry fire extinguishers, fire blankets or 
                    other fire safety equipment.

                    Another form of fire dancing comes from the people of 
                    Polynesia. It is believed that the Maori people of New 
                    Zealand would soak a ball attached to string in fuel, light
                    it and perform dancing rituals. "Poi" is a Maori word
                    meaning â€œball on a string" making the Maori people the 
                    originators of the flow equipment still popular today.[4]
