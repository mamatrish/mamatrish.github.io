                <h1>Meet Spot!</h1>
                <p>
                    Spot is a spirited Dalmatian whose playful personality is 
                    as striking as his signature black-and-white spots. With 
                    boundless energy and a love for adventure, Spot is always 
                    on the move, whether he’s dashing through the park, 
                    exploring new trails, or simply entertaining everyone with 
                    his lively antics. His sleek coat and athletic build are 
                    complemented by his warm, expressive eyes that seem to 
                    sparkle with mischief. Spot’s loyalty and affection know no 
                    bounds—he’s a true companion who thrives on being by his 
                    humans' side. Whether he's charming everyone with his 
                    friendly demeanor or curling up for some well-deserved 
                    snuggles, Spot brings joy and laughter wherever he goes.
